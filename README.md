# README file for CME 241 (Winter quarter 2020)

## `./processes` folder

This folder contains Python files for the implementation of Markov Processes, Markov Reward Processes and Markov Decision Processes. All these processes are modelled as Python `class`. Here,the objective is to define objects that will be used in Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. The structure of these classes is incremental where `_MP_` class is the basis for all other processes.
