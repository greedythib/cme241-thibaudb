# README file for CME 241 (Winter quarter 2020)

## Lectures

The _pdf_ files are meant to be a summary of the most important notions studied in lectures. 

* `lecture_1.pdf` sums up  the notions of Markov Chains, Value State Function and Optimal Policies studient during lecture 1. 

## `./processes` folder

This folder contains Python files for the implementation of Markov Processes, Markov Reward Processes and Markov Decision Processes. All these processes are modelled as Python `class`. Here,the objective is to define objects that will be used in Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. The structure of these classes is incremental where `_MP_` class is the basis for all other processes. 

### Usage 


This folder also contains a Python file `policy.py` for a Policy implementation. This class is used in the class `_MDP_`.
